	Computes an adjacency relation for the polygons in the decomposition.
	In the effect, computes a graph where the nodes are polygons and the edges

	Assumption:
		The polygons are considered adjacent if their boundaries intersect at an
		edge. If they only touch at a point, then will not be considered
		adjacent.

	Params:
		decomposition: A list of polygons in the canonical form.

	Returns:
		A 2D list representing adjacency relation between polygons.
